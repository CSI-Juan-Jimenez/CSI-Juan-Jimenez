                     Psivewri also makes gaming videos. He has played various games in his channel. He played Happy Wheels, Minecraft and many other games. His minecraft videos are the ones I like because he does some challenges like the underground survival series, which consisted of trying to survive without going to the surface. On some of his videos, he tries to game on old or cheap devices, like when he gamed on a laptop from 2008.

        The videos that I like the most are his tech restoring ones, because that is my hobby. He restores many types of devices like laptops and desktops. He also restores devices from very different eras. He has restored desktops from the 1980's, to some modern iMacs. I have learned a lot from these videos because Psivewri explains what you have to do, and in many cases, the insides of the computer are very messy and hard to understand what is going on.

        Not all Psivewri's videos are about restoring tech or gaming. He makes videos in which he reviews tech, tests tech or funny challenges. A really funny video is the blended McDonald's challenge. In this video, he blends McDonald's food in a blender and drinks it. He has made many videos about testing tech, for example the when he used a 30$ iPhone 3GS.
