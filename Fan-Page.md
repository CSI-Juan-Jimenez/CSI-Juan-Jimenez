Psivewri is a YouTube channel that posts many videos about things I like. He posts videos about gaming, tech reviewing, and my hobby: tech restoring. Psivewri's real name is Natan Sivewright and he is a photographer. He joined YouTube in 2006, and has been posting videos since 2009.

Psivewri also makes gaming videos. He has played various games in his channel. He played Happy Wheels, Minecraft and many other games. His minecraft videos are the ones I like because he does some challenges like the underground survival series, which consisted of trying to survive without going to the surface. On some of his videos, he tries to game on old devices or very cheap ones, which are also fun to watch.

The videos that I most like are his tech restoring ones, because that is my hobby. He restores many types of devices like laptops and desktops. He also restores devices from very different eras. He has restored desktops from the 1980's, to some very modern iMacs. I have learned a lot from these videos because Psivewri explains what you have to do, and in many cases, the insides of the computer are very messy and hard to understand what is going on.

Not all Psivewri's videos are about restoring tech or gaming. He makes videos in which he reviews tech, tests tech or funny challenges. A really funny video is the blended McDonald's challenge. In this video, he blends McDonald's food in a blender, and drinks it. He has made many videos about testing tech, for example the when he used a 30$ iPhone 3GS.
