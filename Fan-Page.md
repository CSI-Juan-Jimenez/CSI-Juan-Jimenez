Psivewri also makes gaming videos. He has played various games in his channel. He played Happy Wheels, Minecraft and many other games. His minecraft videos are the ones I like because he does some challenges like the underground survival series, which consisted of trying to survive without going to the surface. On some of his videos, he tries to game on old devices or very cheap ones, which are also fun to watch.

The videos that I most like are his tech restoring ones, because that is my hobby. He has restored many devices, laptops, desktops, etc. He keeps most of the devices in his computer collection and sometimes he sells them or gives them to charity. It is cool to watch the videos where he restores old devices because most of them are easier to repair than new devices.
